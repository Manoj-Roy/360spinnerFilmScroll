360spinnerFilmScroll
====================
Me and my friends are very passionate about photography and technology especially if you combine those together. We are big fans of analog technologies and film photography. One day we came across this gem 360 Spinner Film Camera. It produces 360 panoramic film scroll. Idea was to digitize and play around with scanned developed film strips. I created 2 infinite panoramic film scroller loops and place them against each other. With vertically flipped bottom scroller. Should be touch enabled and have auto scrolling on load.
